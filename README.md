# 🌩️ Cloud Platforms Overview: AWS vs Azure vs GCP

This repository provides a clear comparison and learning roadmap for the three major cloud platforms: **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
It is designed for **beginners, intermediate learners, and advanced users** who want to understand cloud concepts and services progressively.

## ☁️ Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is the world’s most widely adopted cloud platform, offering a broad set of services for compute, storage, databases, networking, security, analytics, and more. It supports startups, enterprises, and everything in between.

### 🔰 Beginner Concepts
If you’re new to AWS, start here:
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Virtual servers to run applications  
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Scalable object storage  
- **Lambda:** Serverless compute for running code without managing servers  
- **RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed relational databases  

### ⚙️ Intermediate Concepts
As you grow:
- **ECS / EKS:** Container orchestration services  
- **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adjust compute capacity  
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Isolated virtual networks  
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Secure access management  
- **Security Groups & NACLs:** Network-level security controls  

### 🚀 Advanced Concepts
For deeper expertise:
- **CloudFormation:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- **CodePipeline:** CI/CD automation  
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** Platform as a Service (PaaS)  
- **Redshift / EMR / Kinesis:** Big data and streaming analytics

## ☁️ Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP runs on Google’s global infrastructure and is known for its strengths in **data analytics, AI/ML, and Kubernetes**.

### 🔰 Basic Concepts
- **Projects:** Core organizational unit in GCP  
- **Compute Engine:** Virtual machines  
- **Cloud Storage:** Object storage  
- **Cloud SQL:** Managed relational databases  
- **App Engine:** Serverless application platform  
- **IAM:** Identity and access management  

### ⚙️ Intermediate Concepts
- **VPC:** Private networking  
- **Load Balancing & Cloud CDN:** High availability and low latency  
- **Cloud Functions:** Serverless compute  
- **BigQuery:** Serverless data warehouse  
- **Pub/Sub:** Messaging service  

### 🚀 Advanced Concepts
- **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine):** Managed Kubernetes  
- **AI & ML APIs:** Vision, Speech-to-Text, Translation  
- **Cloud Spanner:** Globally distributed database  
- **Anthos:** Hybrid and multi-cloud management  
- **Deployment Manager:** Infrastructure as Code

## ☁️ Microsoft Azure

Azure is deeply integrated with the Microsoft ecosystem and is widely used by enterprises, especially those using **Windows, Active Directory, and .NET** technologies.

### 🔰 Core Services
- **Virtual Machines:** Compute services  
- **Blob Storage:** Object storage  
- **Azure SQL Database:** Managed relational databases  
- **Azure Functions:** Serverless compute  

### ⚙️ Intermediate Services
- **Virtual Networks (VNet):** Private networking  
- **Azure Load Balancer & Application Gateway**  
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**  
- **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics**  

### 🚀 Advanced Services
- **ARM Templates / Bicep:** Infrastructure as Code  
- **Azure DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines  
- **Defender for Cloud:** Security posture management  
- **Synapse Analytics:** Data warehousing and analytics
