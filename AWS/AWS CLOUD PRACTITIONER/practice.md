## 25. What is the definition of economy of scale in AWS?

Economy of scale is a concept in which the average cost of production decreases as the volume of output increases. In AWS, this concept refers to the ability to decrease cost per unit of computing power as the size of an operation increases. This is made possible by the fact that AWS operates on a pay-per-use model, which means businesses only pay for the resources they use. As more resources are used, the overall cost decreases. Therefore, “The ability to decrease cost per unit…” is the correct answer.

“The increased cost of operating…” is incorrect because it suggests that the cost of operating additional resources increases, which is not the case with economy of scale. “The cost of computing power…” is incorrect because the cost of computing power is not constant and actually decreases with the increase in an operation's size. Lastly, “the increased cost of hosting larger quantities…” is incorrect because hosting larger quantities of data does not directly relate to economy of scale in AWS.
