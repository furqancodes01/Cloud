## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on series, I'm learning cloud networking—VPCs, subnets, routing, and security. After 9 projects, I’ll have real experience designing and managing networks. I’m learning this because it’s the backbone of modern cloud infrastructure.

Businesses traditionally had to build and manage physical networks with hardware.
Cloud networking changed this by making networks virtual, scalable, and easier to manage in the cloud.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside 5 hours every week to work on this networking series.
I will keep myself accountable by tracking progress after each project and sharing updates.
My reward is treating myself to a fun break once I finish all 9 projects.

### What are networks?

A network is a group of connected devices that share information and resources with each other.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a secure, isolated network environment in the cloud where you can launch and manage your resources like servers, databases, and applications.
